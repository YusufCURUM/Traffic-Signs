# Traffic-Signs  

A project that stretched my understanding of Neural Networks especially CNNâ€™s and their successful use in Computer Vision. I built the network on Keras framework running on top of Tensorflow backend, trained on Google Colab using thousands of images in the training set and attained an accuracy of 98.53% against the test set. I further tested the model on some independent external data and it performed well.
